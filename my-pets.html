    <h1>My pets</h1>
    <h2>Here's a list of all of my pets.</h2>
    <h3>I don't have any.</h3>
    <h3>But what if I did?</h3>
    <p>What would I want in a pet?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I'd like it to be a dog.</li>
        <li>I'd like the dog to be an Irish Wolfhound.</li>
        <li>But maybe I'd start with something more manageable, like a greyhound!</li>
        <li>My dog would be fast during playtime but chill during inside time.</li>
        <li>I would love my dog and take good care of him/her!</li>
      </ul>
